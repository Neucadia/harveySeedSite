Festuloliums are a hybrid between ryegrass (either annual, Italian, or perennial) and meadow fescue or tall fescue. It is a high sugar content perennial that is great for grazing or hay production. Festuloliums exhibit yields higher than perennial ryegrass, similar forage quality, and high disease resistance, persistence, and winterhardiness.
