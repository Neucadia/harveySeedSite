Perennial ryegrass is a high-quality, high sugar content, cool-season grass. It is not as persistent as other forage grasses such as orchardgrass. It is not as winterhardy as smooth bromegrass. It performs very well under intensive grazing conditions and should be on a 21 to 25 day rotation. In general, perennial ryegrass needs to be grazed, chopped, or wet wrapped. It is a slow drying hay crop due to its high moisture content and thick, waxy cuticle.
