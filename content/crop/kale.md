Kale is a summer seeded brassica that is used for fall grazing. It has low fiber stems and is easily digested by livestock. It needs to be seeded when soil temperatures are above 50°F. Kale works well as an intermediate crop when renovating pastures.

 - Smooth leaves with a sweet taste
 - Winterhardy variety
 - Excellent regrowth when rotationally grazed
 - Small stems, very palatable
 - Deep taproot to loosen hardpan
