Adapted to the same general area as red clover. Alsike clover makes a very palatable, high-quality hay when planted with other clovers and grasses, especially timothy. Alsike produces high-quality pasture and hay. It prefers a heavy, moist soil and will do better than other clovers on poorly drained acid soils. Alsike clover does not do well in light, sandy soils.

 - Adapted to similar areas as red clover
 - Grows on wide range of heavier soils
 - Can tolerate standing water for 7-14 days
 - Deep branched taproot
 - Great winterhardiness

**Precautions: Bloat potential, photo sensitivity,
not for horses, slow drying for hay**
