Annual ryegrass is quick establishing and capable of producing high forage yields in a short period of time. It is a very competitive winter annual cool-season grass that works well as a cover crop, forage, and erosion control. Do not use common varieties of annual ryegrass as a cover crop because they may not have adequate winterhardiness, may not have an adequate disease package, or may not break dormancy evenly in the spring.
