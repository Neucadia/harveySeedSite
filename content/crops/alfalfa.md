## The only independent alfalfa breeding program in the U.S.

Legacy Seeds is excited about alfalfa! Our alfalfa breeding program began in 2000 and has since introduced many excellent varieties, including L-449 APH2, L-455 HD and multiple private-label varieties that perform exceptionally well on the farm and in university yield trials. Legacy Seeds is the only company with StandLife Geneticsâ„¢ protection against multiple strains of Aphanomyces Race 2 for those soils with tougher disease challenges. As of October 2012, Legacy Seeds, Inc. is the only privately owned alfalfa breeding program left in the industry. We hope you will fall in love with Legacy Alfalfa as many other producers have!
