## Michigan proven, Michigan grown, exported to the world

DF wants every grower to succeed, but there is no silver bullet. What works in Iowa, or Indiana, or Ohio may not work at home in Michigan. DF Seeds chooses the best traits to solve the problems on your farm, in your county, in your particular slice of the state. Harvest after harvest DF proves that you donâ€™t need billboards and an advertising budget to grow great seed. Instead, DF spends their time and money investing in research and quality genetics.
